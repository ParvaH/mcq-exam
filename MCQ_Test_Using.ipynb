        "```\r\n",
        "There are 1000 students attempting x questions in a competitive examination, where x is your birthdate coded as ddmmyyyy format.\r\n",
        "For example if your birthday was on 11/12/2000, then x=11122000. Each student can score one mark per right answer, and a penalty of-0.5 marks per wrong answer. \r\n",

        "Your aim should be to reduce time and space complexity, at the same time ensure accurate results.\r\n",

        "Things to consider\r\n",
        "1. Explain the algorithm and logic of the solution in detail.\r\n",
        "2. Explain why you have selected this approach by performing time complexity analysis. Represent the complexity in Big O notation.\r\n",

        "6. Explain the algorithm with a flowchart as well as illustration (can be a hand drawing)\r\n",
        "7. Check the grammar. Avoid spelling mistakes, spacing errors, capitilisation issues etc.\r\n",
        "8. Make your solution unique, even if its a minor advancement from that is already there on internet and literature. Aim to come up with your own ideas.\r\n",
        "9. Spend time on formating the report. If possible make use of LaTex based editors.\r\n",

        "2. Python code\r\n",
        "3. Attach the screenshots of the chat discussions you were involved in discussing the solutions. Highlight your contributions.\r\n",

        "Note\r\n",
        "1. This is a second mid-term, and not a replacement for the first mid-term.\r\n",
        "2. The best among 1st and 2nd mid-term will be considered as final marks. If you score less in mid-term 2, in comparison with mid-term 1, in such case, the marks scored in midterm 2 will be considered as bonus marks. The bonus marks will not exceeding 5% of the marks scored in the mid-term 1.\r\n",
        "3. The mid-term one, and the mid-term two are expected to be attempted. In case, mid-term one was missed due to unavoidable reasons such as late joining or medical reasons only the marks from mid-term two will be counted.\r\n",
